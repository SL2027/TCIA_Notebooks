# TCIA_Notebooks
This is a home for notebooks which demonstrate how to access and work with TCIA datasets. Most of them heavily leverage functionality from [tcia_utils](https://pypi.org/project/tcia-utils/).

# Environment Setup
* [EnvironmentCheck.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/EnvironmentCheck.ipynb) - Checks the environment that you are running in to make sure that all required dependencies and extensions are correctly installed. Ideally run first before any other notebooks to prevent common issues around dependencies and extension loading.

# General Notebooks
*  [TCIA_Linux_Data_Retriever_App.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_Linux_Data_Retriever_App.ipynb) - A tutorial on how to install the [NBIA Data Retriever command-line Data Retriever utility on Linux](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/2QKPBQ) and use it to download TCIA datasets
*  [TCIA_REST_API_Queries.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_REST_API_Queries.ipynb) - A Python tutorial on how to use TCIA's REST API to ***query*** datasets
*  [TCIA_REST_API_Downloads.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_REST_API_Downloads.ipynb) - A Python tutorial on how to use TCIA's REST API to ***download*** datasets
*  [TCIA_Series_UID_Report.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_Series_UID_Report.ipynb) - Ingests a file containing TCIA Series Instance UIDs (e.g. TCIA manifest file or CSV of UIDs) and creates reports that summarize those scans
* [TCIA_Aspera_CLI_Downloads.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_Aspera_CLI_Downloads.ipynb) - A short tutorial on how to download TCIA datasets that are made available through Aspera via the command line (rather than via the Aspera browser plugin).  TCIA typically uses Aspera for downloading histopathology collections or radiology collections that were provided in a format other than DICOM.

# AI and Visualization Notebooks
* [TCIA_Image_Visualization_with_itkWidgets.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_Image_Visualization_with_itkWidgets.ipynb) - Example of downloading TCIA DICOM images and visualizing them as interactive cinematic volume renderings or as 2D slices, using [itkWidgets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets).
* [TCIA_MONAI_Model_Zoo.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_MONAI_Model_Zoo.ipynb) - Demonstrates downloading data from TCIA, downloading a pre-trained model from [MONAI's Model Zoo](https://monai.io/model-zoo.html), applying the model to the data to segment anatomic structures in that data, and then visually comparing model results with expert segmentations.
* [TCIA_RTStruct_SEG_Visualization_with_itkWidgets.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_RTStruct_SEG_Visualization_with_itkWidgets.ipynb) - Tutorial of downloading expert annotations as DICOM SEG and RTSTRUCT objects, converting them to labelmaps for use in training and evaluating AI models, and visualizing them with their source images in 3D or as overlays on 2D slices.
* [TCIA_STL_Visualization_with_itkWidgets.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_STL_Visualization_with_itkWidgets.ipynb) - Shows how to download, convert, and visualize expert annotations and 3D printer models stored in STL format on TCIA for use in training and evaluating AI models.

# Collection-specific Notebooks
*  [ACNS0332.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/ACNS0332/ACNS0332.ipynb) - A tutorial on accessing DICOM images, clinical data, and tumor annotations (3d segmentations & seed points) related to the ["Annotations for Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Previously Untreated, High-Risk Medulloblastoma/PNET (ACNS0332-Tumor-Annotations)"](https://doi.org/10.7937/D8A8-6252) dataset hosted on TCIA
*  [AREN0532.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/AREN0532/AREN0532.ipynb) - A tutorial on accessing DICOM images, clinical data, and tumor annotations (3d segmentations & seed points) related to the ["Annotations for Vincristine, Dactinomycin, and Doxorubicin With or Without Radiation Therapy or Observation Only in Treating Younger Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Newly Diagnosed Stage I, II, or III Wilms' Tumor (AREN0532-Tumor-Annotations)"](https://doi.org/10.7937/KJA4-1Z76) dataset hosted on TCIA
*  [AREN0533.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/AREN0533/AREN0533.ipynb) - A tutorial on accessing DICOM images, clinical data, and tumor annotations (3d segmentations & seed points) related to the ["Annotations for Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Radiation Therapy in Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III or Stage IV Wilms Tumor (AREN0533-Tumor-Annotations)"](https://doi.org/10.7937/WFCC-DA41) dataset hosted on TCIA
*  [AREN0534.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/AREN0534/AREN0534.ipynb) - A tutorial on accessing DICOM images, clinical data, and tumor annotations (3d segmentations & seed points) related to the ["Annotations for Combination Chemotherapy and Surgery in Treating Young Patients With Wilms Tumor (AREN0534-Tumor-Annotations)"](https://doi.org/10.7937/N930-BM78) dataset hosted on TCIA
