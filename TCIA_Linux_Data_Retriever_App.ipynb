However, HIPAA constraints make sharing medical images outside an individual institution a complex process. [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) is a public service funded by the National Cancer Institute that addresses this challenge by providing hosting and de-identification services to take major burdens of data sharing off researchers. \n",
