        "**tcia_utils** contains a **downloadSeries()** function that has multiple options for specifying the seriesUids you'd like to download.  By default, the function expects JSON data containing \"SeriesInstanceUID\" elements, which can be generated using **getSeries()** or **getCart()**.  However, if you have a series UID list from some other source, you can set **input_type = \"list\"** to pass a python list of one or more series UIDs instead of JSON. \n",

        "\n",
